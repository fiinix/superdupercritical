  <h1 class="page-heading gamma">Hi, I&rsquo;m Carlos Eriksson</h1>

  <div class="lead">
    <p>Carlos makes the places you can visit from a computer better for everyone, not just the people it is easy for.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Since working closely with people with permanent mental and physical disabilities back in Finland ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®, Carlos has been on an over decade-long quest to make the web better for everyone, not just the people it is easy for.</p>
  <p>His hands-on experience supporting and helping people live independent lives and seeing the broken state of the web they had to endure became the driving force for change.</p>
  <p>Since then, heâ€™s been championing to create a more inclusive technology industry by first recognising exclusion.</p>
  <p>Itâ€™s only through the lens of exclusion, and the mismatch it creates between people and technology that we can understand how vital it is that we include everyone; from people with permanent, temporary and situational disabilities to marginalised and underrepresented groups.</p>
  <p>From collaborating with charities, such as Kent Association for the Blind where he led user-testing with people with visual impairments, to educating stakeholders and teams at agencies of the Cabinet Office with paradigm-shifting lessons and workshops his stories always comes back to people.

  <blockquote>
    <p>At the end of the day, the web is still built by people, for people.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>By partnering, in his capacity at Studio 24, with country-wide reshaping major projects, such as HS2 and Heathrow Expansion, Carlosâ€™ impact can be seen in the barriers-to-entry he has removed.</p>

  <p>By working with prolific charities, such as the Internet Watch Foundation and Fauna & Flora International, he has been making sure their services reach as many people as possible.</p>

  <p>With teaching, public speaking and by writing in industry-recognised print publications, such as net magazine, he continues to educate and empower peers and people alike, on how to transform their organisations to make a better web for everyone.</p>
